# OotDL Calendar for Roll20

## Commands

`!cal`

- Prints the current date

`!cal month`

- Print the current month's calendar to the chat

`!cal advance [days]`

- Advance the calendar by a number of days.
- GM Only

`!cal reduce [days]`

## Notes

- Currently, only the whispers to the GM when the calendar is advanced/reduced are saved in the chat archive.
- A version change will result in a reset of the calendar.
- I apologize for the long file length, the first 53k lines or so are boiler plate from the Kotlin transpiler.
